# Reimann_problem_gas_dynamics
Shock wave propagation (Riemann problem) in gas dynamics is solved by Godunov scheme, Runge-Kutta method with artificial dissipation and Godunov scheme with MUSCL.

A brief summary of the files in this project is as follows:

1. `Reimann_problem.pdf`
Comprehensive report on the solving the [Reimann problem in Gas Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_problem) in one dimension using Godunov scheme, Runge-Kutta method with artificial dissipation and Godunov scheme with MUSCL.

## Work in progress

-> developing interactive python modules for the matlab files to directly execute without MATLAB
